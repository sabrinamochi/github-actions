# ‚òùÔ∏è First, a name for our Action. This will be displayed in the GitHub Actions tab.
name: Hello, data!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Next, give it a trigger -- when do you want the action to run? On a push, pull, schedule?
on:
  # ‚åõÔ∏è We want to schedule it
  schedule:
    # "cron" is your Unix-like operating systems' way of interpreting time. It's an expression made of five fields which represent the time to execute a command.
    #  More information here: https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_*.
    - cron: "*/10 * * * *"
    # The keyword `workflow_dispatch` will let us manually run the Action on GitHub.
    # Without this keyword, we would have to wait for 10 minutes every time
    # to test and see how the action turned out.
  workflow_dispatch:

# üíº Finally, let's tell our file what command to execute. A GitHub Action can be made up of several such jobs.
jobs:
  # Give this particular job a name, `hello_world`.
  get-data:
    # Tell the GitHub Action what kind of virtual machine to run on. In our case, we'll be using the latest version of Ubuntu.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Within this job, let's define our commands in steps

    steps:
      # First, we need to clone the repo on the Ubuntu virtual runner.
      # This is just like you would clone a repo on your computer before exploring the code within it.
      - name: check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Next, we will execute a simple command, that uses curl to get the CSV
      - name: fetch data
        run: |-
          curl "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.csv" -o usgs_current.csv
      # Lastly, after the Action has run on a virtual machine, we will need to commit and push the file back to
      # this repo, so we can access it there.
      - name: Commit and push
        run: |-
          git config user.name "Automated"
          git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add -A
          timestamp=$(date -u)
          git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
          git push
